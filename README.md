# REST-JS-Project
REST with javascript project


Context: I was learning about REST, and also back to learning about javascript for unrelated reasons. 
Action: I decided to do this project for a (fake) bakery with REST APIs. for Get, Post, Put, Patch, and Delete bakery items. I created a website with Express, and used CORS for my APIs to work with bakery items.
Result: I created a great version 1.0 and gave this non-existent bakery some web presence.
Reflection: I really enjoyed this project and one day will add on to include some images in the data returns for each specialty baked good. Then see where it goes from there.
