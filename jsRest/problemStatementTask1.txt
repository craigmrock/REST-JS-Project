Problem Statement: 

Small business bakery needs to get started with a web presence for their short menu of 
specialty baked goods. 

Will create a node server and use javascript to build REST APIs to get, post, put, patch, 
and delete bakery items. Also set up resources for customers and orders. Version 1 of the 
website will be created with Express, and use CORS to call REST APIs and return a list of 
bakery items to show interaction with the data.
